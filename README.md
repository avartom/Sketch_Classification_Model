# Sketch Classification Model

Use TensorFlow Keras and a sample of the Quickdraw dataset to build a sketch classification model. The dataset has been sampled to only 10 classes and 10000 observations per class.

Objective: 

Build a baseline classification model then, run a few experiments with different optimizers and learning rates.
